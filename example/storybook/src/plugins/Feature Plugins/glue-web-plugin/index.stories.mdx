## Getting Started

##

<br />

This plugin provides a comprehensive **frontend** solution for your application using **Next.js**.

It offers three types of templates for you to choose from: **next-gluestack-ts**, **next-tailwind-ts**, and **next-ts**.

These templates provide a solid foundation for building your application's **frontend**, with pre-configured settings and libraries to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

##

To add frontend into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:

```sh
$  node glue add @gluestack-v2/glue-plugin-web <instance-name>
```

For instance, let's install an instance named **frontend** in our gluestack project:

```sh
$ node glue add @gluestack-v2/glue-plugin-web frontend
```

After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named after the **frontend** template that will be a basic nextJs project.

This will create a new directory names **client** inside which it will keep the **frontend** directory of your project and will contain all the necessary files and folders for your application's **frontend**.

# Requirements

##

<br />

**Docker** must be installed on the system.

## CLI
