## Getting Started

<br />

This plugin provides a comprehensive **middleware** solution for your application using **molecular**.

These templates provide a solid foundation for building your application's **middleware**, with pre-configured settings and libraries to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To add gateway into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:

```bash
  node glue add glue-plugin-middleware <instance-name>
```

For instance, let's install an instance named **middleware** in our gluestack project:

```bash
  node glue add glue-plugin-middleware middleware
```

After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named after the **server/middleware** template that fires for function add.

This will create a new directory names **server** inside which it will keep the **middleware** directory of your project and will contain all the necessary files and folders for your application's **middleware**.
