## Getting Started

##

<br />

This plugin provides a comprehensive **server functions** solution for your application using **molecular**.

These templates provide a solid foundation for building your application's **server functions**, with pre-configured settings and libraries to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To add gateway into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:

```bash
  node glue add @gluestack-v2/glue-plugin-functions <instance-name>
```

For instance, let's install an instance named **functions** in our gluestack project:

```bash
  node glue add @gluestack-v2/glue-plugin-functions functions
```

After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named after the **server/functions** template that add function.

This will create a new directory names **server** inside which it will keep the **functions** directory of your project and will contain all the necessary files and folders for your application's **function**.

## CLI

- Commands

```bash
  node glue add @gluestack-v2/glue-plugin-functions <instance-name>
```

## Example

Let's create a multiply function which take two numbers as arguments and return multiple of those two number.

- Create a `multiply.ts` file inside **server/functions** folder.
- Let's write our logic inside `multiply.ts`
  ```
  module.exports = async function handler(ctx) {
    const { a, b } = ctx.params;
    return a * b;
  };
  ```
- you can access your params from ctx.params, ctx where is a context.
- let's add our function sdk to client and server sdk so we can access it.
  In order to do that we have to add following code to `server.ts` and `client.ts` inside **config** folder.

  ```
  import functionSdk from '@project/functions-sdk';
  export const config = {
    providers: {
      ... // other sdk
      functionSDK: functionSdk,
    },
  };
  ```

- Now run `node glue build`.
- When we run our application this will run a gateway (molecular app) which will have your functions as service action inside `functions.services.js`.
- That's it!!! you will be able use multiply function from SDK now.
- Let's see how we can use it inside `next app`.

```

```
